# Falbor Important Files

Falbor creates all these files automatically when a user tells it to create a website:
next.config.js
package.json
postcss.config.mjs
tsconfig.json
globals.css - important for design
These are files that are supposed to help with the base of the code that a user downloads and then pastes straight into the computer and it works straight away and it also works with Preview because the website cannot run on the internet without the basic code files and then it builds all the important files like the landing page files and any file that the user tells it to build
 You will edit this file and update it to the files you create, whether it's colors that the user requests, font sizes, or even designs for certain things. Simply update this file in the most professional way you can. Update all the files you need so that the design always runs well and smoothly.:
